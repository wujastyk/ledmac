# ledmac
The original ledmac package by Peter Wilson, March 2003.

In March 2003 Peter Wilson started an attempt to port EDMAC
from TeX to LaTeX. The starting point was EDMAC version 3.16 
as documented on 19 July 1994 (available from [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/ledmac) 
and now [Github](https://github.com/wujastyk/edmac)).

The main documentation file in this repo is [ledmac.pdf](https://github.com/wujastyk/ledmac/blob/master/ledmac.pdf).

See the [Github EDMAC repo](https://github.com/wujastyk/edmac/blob/master/README.md) for further documentation on the history of this package.

Peter Wilson is perhaps best known for authoring the well-known and influential [Memoir package](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir).  Dave Walden conducted a fine interview with Peter in 2006 that can be read [on the TUG website](https://tug.org/interviews/wilson.html).
